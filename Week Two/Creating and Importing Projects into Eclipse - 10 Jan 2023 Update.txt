How to Create a Java Project in Eclipse
=========================================

1. Create a new Eclipse Project from the main menu:
Option A. File -> New -> Java Project
(If Java Project not available in menu selection, then use Option B)
Option B. File -> New -> Project -> Java, Java Project, then Click Next
For both Options...
- Type in the Project name - (e.g Week Two HelloWorld)
- Ensure "Use an execution environment JRE: shows as JavaSE-17 (otherwise select it)
- Ensure that "Create module-info.java file" is unchecked
- Click Next
- If you are presented with the Java Settings Dialogue Box, click on the Source tab
  - Place a check mark beside "Allow output folders for source folders"
  - Uncheck "Create module-info.java file
- Click Finish

Note: If you are presented with the New module-info.java Dialogue Box,
   - Click the "Don't Create Button" to skip this. (If you accidently create the module,
     you will have to delete the project and start over because your software will not
     correctly compile and execute)

2. Create a class file in the Project:
- In the Package Explorer View Window, navigate to Project Name -> src (e.g. Week Two HelloWorld -> src)
- Right-click on the src folder, then -> New -> class
- DO NOT type in a Package name
- Type in the class name - e.g. HelloWorld
- optionally place a check mark beside "public static void main(String[] args)"
  Note: Not all classes have a main method
- optonally click "Generate comments" 
- Click Finish
- The Eclipse Editor window now opens and displays our class HelloWorld, which contains a method called "main"
- You may now type in the remaining java code into the editor window or follow the steps below to import a java code
